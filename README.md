LineReader
==========

A collection of classes to implement a file reader that can read a specific amount 
of the content of a file. Instead of reading the whole file at once the aim is to 
read block wise. The file contents can be read forwards or backwards. 

The included FileReader class originally has been created by Dave DeLong. Here you 
can find his answer on a question at stackoverflow.com.
